# Chatbot JanGPT

Welcome to the JanGPT project! JanGPT is a unique chatbot created to simulate conversations with the author, inspired by his social media posts from platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This innovative concept leverages the power of the [GPT-3.5 turbo](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday) API, a state-of-the-art transformer-based language model. With a contextual understanding spanning 4,096 tokens and training data up until September 2021, JanGPT promises a rich and engaging chat experience.

One of the standout features of JanGPT is its ability to mimic the "voice" of the author. This is achieved through the advanced Text-To-Speech (TTS) capabilities of the OpenAI API, adding an extra layer of immersion to your interactions with the chatbot.
